so...
This is my first foray into vim as well as git...
I think I may be able to do something with this.
It seems useful as an editor, and git seems useful as a comparator
I didn't know windows was that useful either
must be like unix
Can't wait for github!

As for the stated question... looking at the diff can highlight what went wrong (would've been helpful with video wizard ;) )

New question, starting to get ridiculous...
Having the entire history of the file can allow you to roll back to any point in time, allowing to branch amoung other things

Next question (joy)
Google Docs tracks each file seperately because none of them are intrinsically related. However...
Git should, because code is intrinsicaly related. There is a DEFINITE tie between .h and .m/.c/.cpp files

Git log can be used to get all revisions, git diff can be used to get the difference between the two.

Our "dear comrade" asked me to answer "how might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something"
...
Right.
OMG. There is no compairison. This happens ALL THE TIME!!! All of it. ESPECIALLY on Obj-C code that just looks bats**t crazy.
</rant>

I want to try to use git for all of my coding stuff. esp. java and objc.
