When I init a repository, the bkgrnd files are probably created. (As well as a lot of background shenanigans)

I need it because I don't think that creation will be automatic

Staging area is an intermediate place where you can place files that you will want to commit. Useful for selective commiting (such as huge changes in one file with just basic stuff in another)

Well... just changed a real file and its repository thing!!!
I think I'm getting the hang of this!
Soo... The staging area is integral in making one commit per logical change because you can pick which files are in. 
For instance, a "Fixed AVFoundation" error shouldn't be in the same commit as a "Also fixed video ui playback" change (not saying that that is good grammar)

Branches would help when there's an experimental change.
Also, some nice organizational history b/c you don't want that mess of commits that you had to work through before ;)

Diagrams help visualize the branch structure because git doesn't have a GUI (that we've seen (yet...))

Merging two branches together kinda "mashes" the two parts into one.
We represent it in the diagram because it has to do with all version control systems and is a git command.

Automatic merging is nice b/c 
  1) I can't mess it up
  2) It's a lot quicker
Manual merging is nice b/c
  1) You have full control
  2) It forces you to know what you're doing
