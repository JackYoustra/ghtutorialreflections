Ok, remote repos are awesome. 
There are TOO MANY TIMES that I don't have the computer I'm working on and I want to show someone my code.
This could be prevented by remote repos, esp. considering that I'm migrating away from large IDEs and can just use these txt editors.

Pulling changes manually prevents interruptions in the middle of large revisions, preventing annoying breaking code.

Forks are a github thing. They basically make a one-time copy of one's repo.
Clones are like forking, but between github and the computer or the computer and the computer. Forks are github and github.
Branches are just splitting a path in one repo.

Last known state of the remote stored locally is nice because internet is not always around.
If you are in the forest, it would be a lot nicer to just have them on the hdd than have to configure an uplink.

Well, collaboration could be done using google docs.
I personally think that that would be better for me at this stage, but it'll probably evolve to be worse, as the version controlling is a lot less powerful.
